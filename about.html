      <p>
        Welcome to M.I.S. MODEL BALIKA INTER COLLEGE for girls located in Khurja, Dist. Bulandshahr. 
        Our aim is to deliver a deeper learning that empowers the 'whole girl' so she can unleash her potential within and way beyond the classroom.
        We are a top ranked school for girls in Khurja but our aim is broader than this. 
        We want to foster in our girls a life long interest in learning and minds that are open to exploration and enquiry.
