          Welcome to the MIS School, a place of learning and enquiry, where your daughter will be nurtured, challenged and 
          provided with every opportunity to access her full potential. 
          Academic rigour is valued at MIS, but our curriculum is broad and encourages all areas of creativity and innovation.
          From our earliest learners to our senior girls, we want our students to be the best that they can be.
